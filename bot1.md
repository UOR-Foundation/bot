Understood! I will create a comprehensive specification for bot1.js that enhances the cognitive capabilities of the chatbot, focusing on structured knowledge mapping, ephemeral caching of external data, prioritization of user-provided axioms, and refined prompt engineering. This will ensure that the chatbot maintains coherence, avoids overwriting personal context with external information, and incorporates a schema-based reasoning layer for better understanding.

I will provide the full specification shortly.

# Bot1.js: Advanced Cognitive Chatbot Specification

Bot1.js is an enhanced layer over the existing bot.js, adding deeper reasoning, structured memory, and knowledge management. It introduces advanced cognitive capabilities through structured knowledge representation, ephemeral external knowledge caching, and a refined Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The following specification outlines each major enhancement in detail, including data structures, function interfaces, and integration points with bot.js.

## 1. Structured Knowledge Representation

**Objective:** Organize user-provided information into a structured form (e.g., a knowledge graph) for robust reasoning. Bot1.js will extract entities and facts from user inputs, map them to a schema (such as schema.org vocabulary), and store them as **axioms** (ground-truth facts). This structured knowledge base enables logical inferences and consistency across the conversation.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Entity Recognition and Mapping:** When the user provides information (e.g., *"Alice was born in 1980 and lives in Paris."*), bot1.js uses an **Entity Recognition module** to detect key entities (`Alice`, `1980`, `Paris`) and their relationships. It then maps these to a predefined schema:
  - Identify entity types using a schema (for example, `schema.org` terms). In this case, "Alice" would be recognized as a `Person` entity. Properties like birth year and location are mapped to schema.org properties (e.g., `birthDate` or `birthYear`, and `homeLocation` or `address`). The mapping system ensures each piece of data is stored with semantic context ([Schema Markup make Chatbots More Intelligent & Enable Actions](https://www.schemaapp.com/schema-markup/schema-markup-make-chatbots-intelligent/#:~:text=This%20information%20in%20the%20knowledge,similar%20to%20a%20search%20engine)). 
  - Categorize each extracted fact into a **topic or entity category**. For instance, "Alice – born in 1980" is categorized under *Person -> Alice* and *attribute -> birthYear*. This topic tracking allows grouping related facts about the same subject.

- **Structured Knowledge Storage (Knowledge Graph):** The extracted facts (axioms) are stored in a structured format separate from the free-form chat history. We maintain an internal **knowledge graph** or database of facts:
  - Each **Entity** is stored with its type and a set of attributes. For example, an entry for Alice might look like:  
    ```json
    {
      "entity": "Alice",
      "type": "Person",
      "attributes": { "birthYear": 1980, "homeCity": "Paris" }
    }
    ``` 
    This uses schema.org vocabulary for consistency of attribute names where possible. Interlinking entities via this schema-based structure creates a mini knowledge graph of user data ([Schema Markup make Chatbots More Intelligent & Enable Actions](https://www.schemaapp.com/schema-markup/schema-markup-make-chatbots-intelligent/#:~:text=This%20information%20in%20the%20knowledge,similar%20to%20a%20search%20engine)).
  - Each fact or **axiom** can also be stored as a triple (subject, predicate, object) with references to schema definitions. e.g., (`Alice`, `schema:birthYear`, `1980`). Storing knowledge in a graph structure with explicit links makes reasoning more logical and interpretable for the AI ([UOR-Explained.md](file://file-MTqcuXAEhZKg32eLdH2tnM#:~:text=Already%2C%20we%20see%20the%20power,has%20a%20scaffold%20of%20real%E2%80%91world)). The bot can traverse these connections when formulating answers, rather than relying on raw text alone.
  - Axioms are kept in a **dedicated knowledge store** (e.g., a JSON file, NoSQL collection, or in-memory structure) separate from the normal conversation log. This separation ensures the bot can retrieve facts for reasoning without confusion with conversational context.

- **Functionality:** Key functions to implement for this component:
  - `analyzeInput(text: string) -> Axiom[]`: Parses a user input string and returns structured facts/axioms found in it. It leverages NER (Named Entity Recognition) and natural language parsing. For each statement of fact, it produces an `Axiom` object (or triples) with fields like `entity`, `attribute`, `value`, and schema mapping.
  - `storeAxioms(facts: Axiom[], source="user")`: Inserts new user-provided facts into the knowledge base. It uses schema mappings to maintain consistency. Before storing, it invokes the consistency checker (see section 5) to ensure no logical conflicts with existing axioms.
  - `getEntityFacts(entity: string) -> Axiom[]`: Retrieves all stored facts about a given entity or topic. Used for recall when the conversation references a known entity (e.g., if the user later asks, "Where does Alice live?", the bot can fetch Alice’s stored facts).

**Data Schema Modifications:** If using a database, introduce tables/collections for structured knowledge:
  - **`UserAxioms` (Persistent Knowledge)** – Fields: `id`, `entity`, `type`, `attribute`, `value`, `source` (e.g., `"user"`), `timestamp`. Each record represents a user-supplied fact. (Alternatively, an `Entities` collection with embedded attributes can be used as shown above).
  - **`EntityIndex`** – (Optional) Index table mapping entity names to their record IDs or a list of fact IDs. This speeds up lookup by entity or topic.
  - These additions augment the bot’s long-term memory with a structured layer of facts, forming the basis for logical inference. This knowledge base will act as the **authoritative source of truth** for the chatbot’s reasoning.

## 2. Ephemeral Caching of External Content

**Objective:** Allow the bot to incorporate external knowledge (e.g., from Wikipedia or web searches) without contaminating the user's permanent knowledge base. External information is stored in a transient cache that is isolated from user axioms and expires over time or at session termination.

**Implementation Details:**

- **External Knowledge Retrieval:** Bot1.js can invoke external APIs or search modules (for example, a Wikipedia API) when a query requires outside information not found in the user’s knowledge base. The results of these lookups (articles, definitions, etc.) are saved to an **external content cache**. This cache is a separate data partition from the user axioms:
  - External content is stored as documents or snippets with metadata. For instance:  
    ```json
    {
      "id": "wiki_Paris",
      "content": "Paris is the capital of France with population ...",
      "source": "Wikipedia",
      "retrievedAt": "2025-02-23T20:40:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2025-02-23T21:40:00Z"
    }
    ```
    Each entry includes the content text, the source or URL, and timestamps for retrieval and expiration.
  - **Ephemeral Partition:** This external knowledge store is considered *short-term memory*. It exists only for the duration of the user’s session or a defined time-to-live (TTL). The system may implement an in-memory cache or a separate database table (`ExternalCache`) for this. On session end (or after `expiresAt`), these records are purged. This ensures external data doesn’t override or persist alongside the user’s own facts indefinitely.
  - **Metadata Tags:** Every knowledge entry is tagged with its origin. User-provided facts carry a tag like `source: "user"` (or `origin: "axiom"`), whereas external entries have `source: "external"` (with perhaps sub-tags like `"wiki"` or `"web"` to note origin). This metadata allows the retrieval mechanism and prompt constructor to **differentiate sources** and treat them appropriately.

- **Cache Management:** Implement utility functions to manage the external cache:
  - `fetchExternalKnowledge(query: string) -> ExternalEntry[]`: Performs a live search or API call for the given query. Returns a list of external knowledge entries (e.g., top relevant Wikipedia snippets). It immediately stores these entries in the external cache with appropriate metadata and TTL.
  - `getExternalInfo(query: string) -> ExternalEntry[]`: Retrieves relevant external content from the cache for a given query (if already fetched earlier in the session). This function first purges any expired entries to keep the cache fresh. If no recent cached data exists for the query, it will trigger `fetchExternalKnowledge`.
  - `expireExternalCache()` or scheduled cleanup: Ensures that when the session ends or after a certain period, all external entries are deleted or marked invalid. This can be done by comparing `expiresAt` with the current time and removing expired items. The expiration policy prevents stale or contextually irrelevant external data from lingering and guarantees that the bot’s knowledge resets between sessions.

- **Rationale:** By isolating external info, we prevent it from polluting the core knowledge base. The bot will never treat external facts as permanent truths unless confirmed by the user. This design mirrors cognitive architectures that maintain separate short-term and long-term stores ([A framework for cognitive chatbots based on abductive-deductive inference | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=C9wsNAvsRh&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Corrado%20Santoro%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Corrado_Santoro1)#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20This%20paper%20presents%20a,by%20a%20module%20which%20automatically)) – a short-term scratchpad for newly fetched data and a stable long-term memory for user-provided knowledge. The metadata tags and physical separation ensure that, for example, a Wikipedia fact about a topic will not override a user’s own statement about that topic. Instead, the two are kept distinct, with user axioms remaining the primary authority.

## 3. Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Process

**Objective:** Enhance the response generation by retrieving relevant information from the knowledge stores (user axioms and external cache) and feeding it into the model’s context. The system will **prioritize user-provided knowledge** during retrieval, apply weighting to ensure the most pertinent facts are included, and include a verification feedback loop to confirm the model’s output is aligned with known facts.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Context Retrieval Pipeline:** Bot1.js will implement a retrieval module to gather context for a user’s query before generation:
  1. **Query Analysis:** For each incoming user query (especially questions or requests for explanation), the system identifies key terms, entities, or topics in the query. For example, if the user asks, "Where does Alice work?", the key entity is *Alice* and the topic is likely *occupation/employment*.
  2. **User Knowledge Lookup:** The retrieval module first searches the **UserAxioms store** for any facts related to the identified entities/topics. This could be a direct lookup by entity name (using the `EntityIndex` or similar). In the example, it fetches all facts about "Alice". If the knowledge base contains an axiom like *Alice – occupation – Doctor*, that fact is deemed highly relevant.  
     - Relevance scoring: Bot1.js can use a simple keyword match (entity name) or a more advanced semantic search (embedding-based similarity) to find relevant axioms. All matching axioms are collected and given top priority. Each axiom might be assigned a relevance score (e.g., 1.0 for direct matches, etc.). By design, **user axioms receive a higher weight** or priority score to ensure they appear in the final context.
  3. **External Knowledge Lookup:** If the query context is not fully satisfied by user knowledge, the system queries the **ExternalCache**. For instance, if the user asks something that goes beyond stored facts (like "Tell me about Paris" when Paris was only mentioned as a home city), the bot will retrieve supplemental info from the cache (or fetch externally if not cached). External entries are also scored for relevance (e.g., based on keyword overlap with the query or using vector similarity between the query and document text). These items get a slightly lower weighting compared to user axioms. Only the top N external snippets (based on relevance and a maximum context size) will be selected.
  4. **Context Ranking and Selection:** The collected knowledge (both user and external) is then combined into a single relevant set. A ranking algorithm sorts the items primarily by source priority and secondarily by relevance score:
     - All **user-provided axioms** that relate to the query are placed at the top of the context list (these might even be included regardless of score if they directly involve the query’s entity or topic).
     - **External content** is included next, in order of relevance, and only if it adds information not already covered by user facts. (If the user’s knowledge fully answers the query, external info may be unnecessary.)
     - A weighting mechanism can be implemented as follows: if using numeric scores, multiply scores of user facts by a factor (e.g., 1.5x) to guarantee they outrank external bits. Alternatively, the system can simply always prefer user facts in tie-breaking scenarios.
     - This ensures the retrieval-augmented context is **grounded first in the user’s data**, then enriched by outside knowledge if needed. RAG systems that combine internal and external info in this way provide more accurate, up-to-date answers ([RAG Chatbot: What It Is, Benefits, and How to Build One | Tonic.ai](https://www.tonic.ai/guides/rag-chatbot#:~:text=RAG%20workflows%20retrieve%20relevant%20information,inaccuracies%20common%20in%20standalone%20LLMs)), while aligning with user-specific details.
  
- **Retrieval Functions:** Key functions for RAG:
  - `retrieveContext(query: string) -> { axioms: Axiom[], externals: ExternalEntry[] }`: Main function that executes steps 1–4 above. It returns two lists: a list of relevant user axioms and a list of relevant external info snippets for the given query.
    - Internally calls `findAxiomsByTopic(entityOrTopic: string) -> Axiom[]` and `findExternalByTopic(entityOrTopic: string) -> ExternalEntry[]` to get candidates, then applies ranking.
    - Might also call `fetchExternalKnowledge` if no external info is cached for a needed topic.
  - `rankContext(axioms: Axiom[], externals: ExternalEntry[], query: string) -> ContextItem[]`: (If needed as separate) Assigns relevance scores and sorts the combined list. Each `ContextItem` could be an object with `content` and `sourceType` fields (so we know if it’s user or external).

- **Feedback Loop – Verification of Generated Output:** After the model generates a response using the retrieved context, bot1.js introduces a verification step **before finalizing the output**:
  - The draft response is checked against the knowledge base (especially the user axioms) for any contradictions or lapses. This acts as a safeguard to ensure the model didn’t ignore or misstate the known facts.
  - **Automated Consistency Check:** Bot1.js can parse the generated answer to extract factual claims (similarly to how it parses user inputs) and then cross-verify each claim against the stored axioms:
    - If the answer makes a statement that directly conflicts with a stored axiom (e.g., the bot says *"Alice works in London"* but we know *Alice works in Paris* from axioms), the system flags this inconsistency.
    - If the answer references external info that contradicts user info, that is also flagged.
  - Upon detecting a conflict, the system can engage a few possible remedies:
    1. **Regeneration with Emphasis:** It can adjust the prompt or context (for example, explicitly remind the model of the correct user fact it missed) and regenerate the answer, hoping for a corrected response.
    2. **User Clarification:** If the inconsistency might stem from outdated or corrected user info, the bot can pause and ask the user to clarify (see section 5 on Logical Consistency for handling contradictions).
    3. **Omission or Correction:** The bot might remove the conflicting external info from the context and regenerate, or automatically correct the statement in the final answer to align with the known truth.
  - The **feedback loop** ensures the model’s output is vetted against the knowledge base, similar to how new data can be validated against existing knowledge for consistency ([Enhancing Data Consistency in AI-powered Q&A Systems](https://dataroots.io/blog/data-consistency-llm#:~:text=To%20tackle%20the%20challenge%20of,are%20set%20aside%20for%20review)). Only after this verification passes (or adjustments are made) will the answer be presented to the user. This loop significantly reduces the chance of the bot asserting false or contradictory information using the augmented data.

- **Benefit:** By prioritizing user-provided axioms in retrieval and verifying outputs against them, bot1.js maintains high fidelity to the user’s input and intentions. The RAG approach provides the language model with rich, relevant context – *first from the user’s own knowledge, supplemented by external facts* – so it can generate informed answers. This reduces hallucinations and ensures the bot’s answers are both **knowledgeable and personalized** to the user’s context ([RAG Chatbot: What It Is, Benefits, and How to Build One | Tonic.ai](https://www.tonic.ai/guides/rag-chatbot#:~:text=RAG%20workflows%20retrieve%20relevant%20information,inaccuracies%20common%20in%20standalone%20LLMs)).

## 4. Refined Prompt Engineering and Context Injection

**Objective:** Improve the prompt construction for the language model such that the inserted context (especially user axioms vs external info) is organized and labeled clearly. The prompt will be engineered to always highlight user-supplied knowledge first and treat external content as secondary, thereby guiding the model to use the information appropriately in its response.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Prompt Structure:** Every time bot1.js calls the underlying language model (via bot.js) to generate a response, it will craft a structured prompt that injects the retrieved context in a logical order. The general template for the prompt might look like:

  ```text
  [System Instructions:]
  You are a knowledgeable assistant. Use the user's provided facts and any supplemental information to answer the question. Prioritize the user's own information and maintain consistency with it. External info is only to support the answer if needed.

  [Context: User's Knowledge]
  - Fact 1: ... 
  - Fact 2: ... 
  (List all relevant user axioms here)

  [Context: External Information]
  - Info 1: ... (source: Wikipedia)
  - Info 2: ... (source: ... )
  (List relevant external snippets here, if any, or leave blank if none)

  [User's Question]:
  "...user's query..."
  ```

  In this structure:
  - Axioms from the user's knowledge base are explicitly listed first under a clear heading (e.g., "User's Knowledge"). This ensures the model sees these facts upfront. By prefixing them as user-provided facts, we signal that these are to be treated as authoritative context.
  - External content is listed in a separate section with a heading like "External Information" or "Supplemental Info". We can also annotate each item with its source (e.g., Wikipedia, news article) to provide transparency. The prompt (or system instruction) will remind the model that this content is supplemental.
  - The actual user query is placed after the context sections. This ordering ensures the model processes all provided context before formulating an answer.

- **Priority Emphasis in Prompt:** The system instruction or an injected notice can explicitly instruct the model on priority:
  - For example: *"Note: The above **User's Knowledge** is confirmed information from the user and should be considered primary. **External Information** is provided for additional details and should be used only if relevant and not contradicting the user's knowledge."* 
  - This acts as a guiding rule for the model, reducing any confusion if external data differs slightly. The model will bias its answer to align with the user’s facts due to this priming.

- **Context Separation:** Bot1.js will ensure there is a clear delimiter between different context sources in the prompt (as shown by separate labeled sections). This prevents the model from mixing up the provenance of facts. It's effectively like giving the model a mini knowledge article: first the "facts to trust" followed by "extra references." The structured prompt makes the context *explicit and easy to parse* for the model.

- **Additional Context-Awareness Mechanisms:**
  - **Role Prompting:** Use the system role (if the LLM API allows it) to set the stage. For instance, the system message might say: *"You have access to the user's knowledge base and external resources. Always use the user's knowledge base as your primary source."* This reinforces the hierarchy of information sources.
  - **Few-shot Examples (if necessary):** If the model needs guidance, we can include a brief example in the prompt (as a system or hidden prompt) demonstrating how to incorporate a user fact over an external fact. For example, an example dialogue snippet where the user's fact is used to answer despite a differing external info. However, this increases prompt length, so it might be used only if we observe issues in practice.
  - **Dynamic Context Filtering:** If there is a lot of context, bot1.js will be selective. Unnecessary external info will be omitted to avoid diluting the prompt. In other words, if 5 user facts and 5 external snippets are available but only 2 of those are truly relevant, the prompt will include only those 2 (plus all critical user facts). This keeps the prompt focused and within token limits.

- **Functionality:**
  - `composePrompt(query: string, axioms: Axiom[], externals: ExternalEntry[]) -> string`: Constructs the final prompt text as per the above structure. It will take the lists of relevant axioms and external info (from the retrieval step) and format them into the sections. It also injects any necessary instructions about using user vs external data. This function ensures the ordering (user first, external second) is always respected.
  - `modelResponse = baseBot.generateResponse(composePrompt(...))`: Bot1.js will call bot.js’s underlying generation function (here referenced as `generateResponse`) with the composed prompt. Bot.js's core LLM interface is thus leveraged, but now always fed with a knowledge-enriched prompt.

- **Outcome:** With refined prompt engineering, the bot’s answers will be contextually rich yet aligned with user-provided facts. The user’s axiomatic knowledge essentially becomes part of every query’s context, significantly improving the relevance of responses. External info is clearly demarcated, so the model treats it as *background reference* rather than absolute truth, avoiding overrides of the user’s data. This structured approach to prompting makes the chatbot more reliable and transparent in how it uses available information.

## 5. Logical Consistency and Memory Refinement

**Objective:** Maintain a consistent knowledge base over the conversation. Bot1.js will include mechanisms to detect and handle contradictions between new information and what is already known. If the user provides new data that conflicts with stored axioms (or if external info conflicts with user data), the system will address it by seeking clarification or updating the knowledge base appropriately. The goal is to ensure the long-term memory (axioms store) remains coherent and trustworthy.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Contradiction Detection:** Whenever a new axiom is about to be stored (typically from user input analysis), bot1.js performs a check against existing knowledge:
  - The function `checkContradiction(newFact: Axiom) -> ContradictionResult` is invoked. It searches the knowledge base for any fact with the **same entity and attribute** (or a logically related attribute) as `newFact`. 
    - If none exists, there is no conflict; the fact is safe to add.
    - If a matching fact exists, compare the values:
      - For direct factual data (e.g., numbers, names, dates), if the values differ, this is a potential contradiction. Example: existing axiom says *Alice's birthYear = 1980*, and newFact says *Alice's birthYear = 1985*. These cannot both be true.
      - For boolean or status facts (e.g., "X is Y" vs "X is not Y"), detect negation or opposites. For instance, if the knowledge base has "Alice is employed at CompanyA" and new input says "Alice no longer works at CompanyA", that's a contradiction (or an update) on the same predicate.
      - If the new fact negates an old fact explicitly (keywords like "no longer", "not", etc.), recognize it as well.
    - The result of `checkContradiction` could be:
      - **NoConflict**: safe to store.
      - **ConflictFound**: returns references to the conflicting fact(s).
      - **PotentialUpdate**: (optional) a case where the new fact might be intended as an update to old information (e.g., age changed because time passed).
  
- **Conflict Resolution Strategy:** If a contradiction is found:
  - **User Query for Clarification:** Bot1.js will not immediately overwrite or accept the new information. Instead, it will generate a clarification prompt back to the user. For example: *"You previously told me Alice was born in 1980, but now it sounds like 1985. Can you clarify which is correct?"* This query is important to resolve the inconsistency. The bot’s design favors **explicit user confirmation** in the face of conflicting axioms. (This could be implemented by formulating a response via bot.js that highlights the discrepancy and asks for resolution.)
  - **Temporary Suspension of Storage:** The new fact is held in a temporary state (not yet committed to the permanent axioms store) until the conflict is resolved. We might keep it in a variable or a pending queue but not in the official `UserAxioms` store.
  - Once the user responds with clarification, the bot will determine which fact is correct:
    - If the user confirms the new information (e.g., "Sorry, 1985 is the correct birth year"), bot1.js will **update the knowledge base**: remove or mark outdated the old axiom and then store the new one as truth. The knowledge base thus evolves coherently.
    - If the user retracts or corrects the new info (e.g., "Oops, that was a mistake, it’s actually 1980"), then the new (incorrect) input is discarded and the original axiom remains.
  - This approach ensures that contradictory data does not silently enter the knowledge base. All axiomatic knowledge is vetted so the system remains logically consistent ([Enhancing Data Consistency in AI-powered Q&A Systems](https://dataroots.io/blog/data-consistency-llm#:~:text=Knowledge%20graphs%20consolidate%20knowledge%20in,already%20contained%20in%20the%20graph)) ([Enhancing Data Consistency in AI-powered Q&A Systems](https://dataroots.io/blog/data-consistency-llm#:~:text=To%20tackle%20the%20challenge%20of,are%20set%20aside%20for%20review)).

- **Ongoing Consistency Checks:** Apart from user-provided info, consistency is also checked when incorporating external knowledge:
  - If an external snippet contradicts a user axiom, the retrieval weighting (section 3) already de-prioritizes it. Additionally, the bot can exclude that snippet from the context or mention the discrepancy in the answer if appropriate. The rule is: **user axioms take precedence**. The bot will not update its axioms based on external info alone, and it will treat any conflicts by either ignoring the external point or bringing it up to the user carefully.
  - Example: User told the bot "Alice lives in Paris." External search might yield "Alice lives in London" (perhaps outdated or about a different Alice). The bot1.js context builder would either drop the "lives in London" info or, if it keeps it (maybe it thinks it's the same Alice), the answer will clarify: "According to your input, Alice lives in Paris. (Note: Another source mentions London, but I'll trust your information.)" – or it may ask the user to confirm Alice's location. In any case, it **won’t automatically trust the external source over the user**.

- **Memory Refinement and Coherence:**
  - After each user turn, and after any clarification dialogues, bot1.js ensures the knowledge base is tidy:
    - Remove any facts that the user explicitly corrected or invalidated.
    - Possibly annotate facts with context (e.g., if a fact was confirmed or updated by the user).
    - Ensure that no two axioms about the same entity are in direct logical conflict. The knowledge base should behave like a consistent set of assertions (no entity has two different values for the same property at the same time, unless the context explicitly demands it).
    - This could involve a routine `ensureCoherence(entity: string)` that checks all facts about a given entity for consistency whenever that entity’s data is modified.
  - The bot can leverage the knowledge graph structure here: because the data is structured, these consistency checks are straightforward (e.g., checking one field vs another). In a knowledge graph, adding new info allows assessing whether it *supports, contradicts, or extends* what is already there ([Enhancing Data Consistency in AI-powered Q&A Systems](https://dataroots.io/blog/data-consistency-llm#:~:text=Knowledge%20graphs%20consolidate%20knowledge%20in,already%20contained%20in%20the%20graph)).
  - Only **coherent axiomatic knowledge** is kept permanently. This way, any future queries that rely on the knowledge base will be answered from a set of facts that are self-consistent.

- **Functionality:**
  - `checkContradiction(newFact: Axiom) -> boolean` (as described) and a helper `findConflictingFact(newFact)` to retrieve the exact old fact if needed for messaging.
  - `resolveConflict(conflictFact: Axiom, newFact: Axiom) -> Axiom` or user prompt: Handles the logic of asking the user and updating the store based on user’s answer.
  - Internally, `storeAxioms` (from section 1) will utilize `checkContradiction` before finalizing storage of each fact.
  - If an entire topic is rendered obsolete (say a user corrects multiple facts about an entity), bot1.js could also have the ability to prune or update multiple related axioms.

**Summary:** This consistency mechanism makes bot1.js **interactive and self-correcting** with respect to its memory. It does not blindly accumulate facts; it critically evaluates new information against what it "believes" to be true. By doing so, it maintains a high-quality knowledge base and builds trust – the user can rely on the bot to remember things correctly and also to catch inconsistencies (even ones the user might accidentally introduce). The approach follows the principle that a knowledge-based AI should verify new inputs against its existing knowledge, similar to how a knowledge base system validates updates for consistency ([Enhancing Data Consistency in AI-powered Q&A Systems](https://dataroots.io/blog/data-consistency-llm#:~:text=To%20tackle%20the%20challenge%20of,are%20set%20aside%20for%20review)). Contradiction handling also provides a more engaging experience, as the bot might ask intelligent clarification questions, demonstrating understanding of context and memory.

## 6. Integration with bot.js (Base Functionality Leveraging)

**Objective:** Bot1.js will integrate with the existing bot.js to extend its capabilities without replacing them. It acts as a middleware or enhancement layer that intercepts user inputs, manages the advanced reasoning tasks (knowledge handling and context building), and then delegates to bot.js for the core language model response. The integration is designed to be seamless, so bot.js’s base functions (like generating a reply, handling dialogue flow) are reused, augmented by pre- and post-processing in bot1.js.

**Architecture Overview:**

- **Wrapper/Enhancement Layer:** Bot1.js is essentially a wrapper around bot.js. It may be implemented as a subclass (if bot.js exports a class) or as a separate module that **imports and uses bot.js's functions**. The key idea is that the user will interface with bot1.js exactly as they did with bot.js (same public API for sending messages), but internally bot1 handles additional steps:
  1. **Interception:** When a user message comes in, it is first passed to bot1.js (instead of directly to bot.js). For example, if previously one would call `bot.handleMessage(userInput)`, now they call `bot1.handleMessage(userInput)`.
  2. **Pre-Processing:** Bot1’s `handleMessage` will:
     - Parse the input and update the knowledge base (`analyzeInput` and `storeAxioms` as needed for any facts stated by the user).
     - Determine if the user input is a query that needs an answer (versus just providing info). If it’s a question or request, bot1 triggers the context retrieval (`retrieveContext`) to gather relevant axioms and external data.
     - Compose the enhanced prompt with all relevant context (`composePrompt`).
  3. **Delegating to bot.js:** After constructing the final prompt, bot1 calls the underlying bot’s generation method. Depending on how bot.js is structured, there are two possible integration strategies:
     - *Strategy A: Using bot.js’s API for generating replies.* For example, if bot.js has a function `generateReply(prompt, context)` or it normally would build a prompt from conversation, we instead supply our already composed prompt. Bot1 might use something like `bot.generateFromPrompt(enhancedPrompt)` if available. If bot.js expects just user input and internally uses its own context, we may need to **inject our context as a system message or initial message** before the user message in bot.js’s pipeline. (This might involve minor modification to bot.js to accept an optional context parameter.)
     - *Strategy B: Direct LLM Call with bot.js's settings.* If bot.js primarily manages the LLM API call (with certain parameters, API keys, etc.), bot1 can directly call a lower-level function from bot.js responsible for communicating with the model. For instance, `bot.sendToModel(fullPrompt)` which returns the model's response. This reuses bot.js’s model interface but bypasses its prompt construction since we handle that.
     - In either case, bot.js is providing the **LLM invocation and baseline conversational capabilities** (such as maintaining token limits, formatting, or any other post-processing it normally does), while bot1 provides the custom context.
  4. **Post-Processing:** Once bot.js returns a draft answer from the model, bot1 takes over again:
     - It runs the **verification feedback loop** (Section 3) by calling `verifyResponse(draftAnswer, usedContext)`. This checks the answer against known axioms for consistency.
     - If verification passes, bot1 finalizes the answer. If not, bot1 may adjust the prompt or ask a clarification as described earlier. In a clarification scenario, bot1 might actually interrupt the normal flow to get user input (which means an additional round of conversation before finalizing the answer).
     - Bot1 can also format the final answer if needed (though likely bot.js already handles basic formatting).
  5. **Output:** Finally, bot1 delivers the answer to the user. From the user’s perspective, they just see a coherent answer or a clarification question from the bot as appropriate. 

- **State and Memory Management:** Bot1.js works alongside bot.js’s existing conversation memory:
  - Bot.js likely keeps track of the conversation history (previous user and assistant messages) to provide context for the model. Bot1 should ensure this still happens. For example, after generating a reply, it could call `bot.appendConversation(userInput, botReply)` to log the turn if bot.js has such functionality. This means the next turn, bot.js is aware of prior conversation as usual.
  - The structured knowledge base (user axioms, external cache) is managed by bot1 separately. Bot.js’s conversation history remains separate from this structured memory. Bot1 might not need to modify bot.js’s storage of chat history at all, just supplement it.
  - In essence, there are **two parallel memory systems**: the unstructured dialogue history (managed by bot.js) and the structured knowledge memory (managed by bot1). Bot1 coordinates them. For example, when retrieving context, bot1 uses the structured memory; when composing the prompt, it may combine structured memory content with a brief summary of conversation context if needed (or rely on the model’s ability with dialogue history).

- **Function Interfaces and Interaction Points:**
  - `bot1.handleMessage(userInput: string)`: Main entry that orchestrates the flow. Pseudocode for this function:
    ```js
    function handleMessage(userInput) {
       const newFacts = analyzeInput(userInput);
       if(newFacts.length > 0) {
          storeAxioms(newFacts, "user");
       }
       if(isQuery(userInput)) {
          // If the user input expects an answer (not just providing info)
          const { axioms, externals } = retrieveContext(userInput);
          const prompt = composePrompt(userInput, axioms, externals);
          let draftAnswer = bot.generateResponse(prompt);  // call base bot.js
          if(!verifyResponse(draftAnswer)) {
             // If verification fails, possibly adjust prompt or ask clarification
             if(conflictDetected) {
                return askUserForClarification(conflictDetails);
             }
             // or regenerate answer with corrected info
             draftAnswer = bot.generateResponse(adjustPrompt(prompt, conflictDetails));
          }
          // Log the interaction in base bot memory
          bot.appendConversation(userInput, draftAnswer);
          return draftAnswer;
       } else {
          // If user was just giving information (no direct question)
          // Acknowledge or continue without calling LLM, or perhaps formulate a brief confirmation using bot.js
          return bot.generateResponse(simpleAcknowledgePrompt(userInput));
       }
    }
    ```
    In the above pseudo-code, `bot.generateResponse` and `bot.appendConversation` are base bot.js functionalities. Bot1 augments around them. The actual implementation will depend on how bot.js is structured, but this outlines the interception and processing.
  - **Use of bot.js components:** If bot.js is a class with methods, Bot1 might extend it:
    ```js
    class Bot1 extends Bot {
       // override or extend methods
       handleMessage(msg) { ... }  // as above
    }
    ```
    Bot1 can call `super.handleMessage()` if needed or bypass it to implement its own sequence (likely the latter, since we need custom behavior).
  - Bot1 does not remove any existing features of bot.js; it only adds new ones. For example, if bot.js had sentiment analysis or small-talk capabilities, those remain intact. Bot1 simply makes the bot smarter in handling knowledge.

- **Database Integration:** If bot.js used a database (for user profiles or chat logs), bot1 will introduce new collections as described in sections 1 and 2. Bot1.js will handle interactions with these collections (in functions like `storeAxioms`, `fetchExternalKnowledge` etc.). Bot.js itself might not be aware of these new data stores at all. This modular approach means bot.js could remain unchanged, and bot1 injects the new logic by hooking around it.

- **Error Handling and Fallbacks:** Integrating an advanced layer means considering failure modes:
  - If the external knowledge API fails or times out, bot1 will simply proceed with available user knowledge (and maybe apologize or indicate limited info if needed).
  - If the knowledge parsing fails (e.g., user said something complex the system didn't parse into an axiom), bot1 will just not store anything for that turn and still attempt to answer via bot.js normally. This ensures robustness – the worst case is the bot behaves like the original bot.js (no advanced knowledge) if something goes wrong, rather than breaking entirely.
  - Bot1 can log activities for debugging (like logging when it added an axiom or detected a conflict) so developers can trace the enhanced layer’s actions on top of bot.js's actions.

**Summary:** Bot1.js acts as an **intermediate brain** layered on the original bot. It intercepts user input, uses advanced cognition (structured memory, retrieval, reasoning checks), and then uses bot.js’s generative capabilities to produce answers. The integration is designed to be clean: bot.js can remain the core responder, but now fed with richer context and governed by consistency rules enforced by bot1. From an implementation standpoint, this means minimal changes to bot.js – mainly ensuring bot1 can call into its response generation function and possibly supply a pre-built prompt. The result is a chatbot with the same interface as before but much improved reasoning, achieved by plugging in the bot1.js enhancements.

## Key Components and Function Signatures

To summarize the implementation, here are the main components of bot1.js with their roles and interfaces, and any data schema changes required:

- **Knowledge Parser & Mapper**: Extracts structured facts from user input.
  - `function analyzeInput(inputText: string) -> Axiom[]` – Uses NLP to recognize entities and relations in `inputText`. Returns a list of `Axiom` objects (or an empty list if the input contains no factual statements).
  - `function mapToSchema(entity: string, attribute: string) -> {schemaClass, schemaProp}` – (Optional helper) Maps a detected entity/attribute to schema.org types/properties for consistency in representation.

- **Knowledge Base Manager**: Stores and retrieves axioms.
  - `function storeAxioms(facts: Axiom[], source: string="user")` – Saves each fact into the persistent knowledge store (UserAxioms collection). Attaches metadata (source, timestamp). Calls `checkContradiction` for each `fact` before insertion to ensure consistency.
  - `function checkContradiction(newFact: Axiom) -> boolean` – Checks if `newFact` conflicts with an existing fact. Returns true/false or perhaps a conflict object. May utilize a small inference rule set (e.g., to catch negations).
  - `function resolveConflict(oldFact: Axiom, newFact: Axiom) -> void` – Handles updating or discarding facts based on user input when a conflict is found. (This might be invoked after asking the user, as described in section 5.)
  - `function getFactsByEntity(name: string) -> Axiom[]` – Retrieves all axioms about a given entity from the knowledge base for use in context retrieval.

- **External Knowledge Cache**:
  - `function fetchExternalKnowledge(query: string) -> ExternalEntry[]` – Searches an external source (e.g., via API) for information related to `query`. Populates the ExternalCache with results. Each `ExternalEntry` might include fields: `content`, `source`, `retrievedAt`, `expiresAt`.
  - `function getExternalByEntity(name: string) -> ExternalEntry[]` – Looks up any cached external info about a given entity or topic. Returns relevant snippets if present and not expired.
  - `function cleanExternalCache()` – Purges expired entries. Could be called periodically or at session end.

- **Context Retrieval & Ranking**:
  - `function retrieveContext(userQuery: string) -> {userFacts: Axiom[], externalFacts: ExternalEntry[]}` – Main retrieval function combining user axioms and external info for the query. Implements the logic of gathering and weighting as described in section 3.
  - `function rankContextItems(items: ContextItem[], query: string) -> ContextItem[]` – (Optional) Assigns scores and sorts a list of context items. Ensures user-origin items rank higher. Could use a simple heuristic or more complex semantic ranking.
  - Data structure: `ContextItem` might be a unified type with `{text: string, sourceType: "user"|"external", score: number}`.

- **Prompt Constructor**:
  - `function composePrompt(query: string, userFacts: Axiom[], externalFacts: ExternalEntry[]) -> string` – Builds the final prompt string or structured message with sections for user facts and external info, followed by the query. It will include any necessary instructions to the model about using the information.
  - (If using an API with system/user messages, this function might return an array of message objects instead, e.g., a system message containing all context and a user message for the query.)

- **Response Verification**:
  - `function verifyResponse(draftAnswer: string) -> boolean` – Analyzes the LLM’s draft answer against the knowledge base. Returns true if consistent, or false if it finds a contradiction or misuse of info.
  - `function analyzeAnswerConsistency(answer: string) -> { conflictWith: Axiom or null }` – (Optional) Similar to analyzeInput, it can extract factual claims from the answer and check each against the knowledge base. If any claim conflicts with a stored axiom, it identifies which axiom.
  - These functions may rely on the same knowledge base queries used for contradictions. In some cases, instead of a boolean, `verifyResponse` could return a result indicating what is wrong (so the calling code knows whether to adjust prompt or ask user).

- **Main Interaction**:
  - `async function handleMessage(userInput: string) -> string` – Or similarly named, this high-level function glues everything:
    1. Determine if input contains facts to store (`analyzeInput` and `storeAxioms`).
    2. If input is a query needing answer: 
       - retrieve context (`retrieveContext`),
       - compose prompt (`composePrompt`),
       - get answer from base bot (`bot.generateResponse` or similar),
       - verify answer (`verifyResponse`).
       - If verification fails due to contradiction, possibly initiate clarification dialogue.
    3. If input was just information (not a direct question), possibly respond with an acknowledgment or continue the conversation without a heavy RAG process.
  - This function uses bot.js’s capabilities for generating the actual language response. It might call something like `bot.generateResponse` internally (after preparing the prompt). It will also ensure to log or maintain conversation state via bot.js (e.g., calling `bot.memory.add(userInput, reply)` if such exists).

- **Database Schema Changes:** As noted:
  - New **UserAxioms** collection for structured facts (with fields: entity, type, attribute, value, source, etc.).
  - New **ExternalCache** collection for external content (fields: content, source, retrievedAt, expiresAt, etc.). Consider indexing by entity/topic for quick lookup.
  - Possibly update existing user/session schema to link to these (e.g., a user ID or session ID field in the knowledge entries, if bot supports multiple user profiles or concurrent sessions).

Bot1.js will be thoroughly documented and modular, making each of these functions testable in isolation (e.g., one can unit test that contradiction detection works, or that prompt composition format is correct). The interplay with bot.js will be carefully managed so that if bot.js is updated or replaced (for instance, switching out the LLM), bot1.js can continue to function by simply using the new generate function or API keys, with minimal changes to its knowledge-handling logic.

By following this specification, the implementation of bot1.js will result in a chatbot that not only engages in conversation but also **learns and maintains facts, uses them intelligently, sources external information without losing track of the user's context, and stays logically consistent**. Each enhancement works in concert: the structured memory provides a strong knowledge foundation, the RAG pipeline brings in relevant info on demand, prompt engineering ensures the model sees the right context, and consistency checks keep the knowledge base clean and reliable. All of these sit on top of the original bot.js, augmenting it into a more **cognitively advanced chatbot**. 

The end result will be a system that can answer user queries with greater accuracy and personalization, remember what the user has told it (and reason about that information), and gracefully handle new information – all while leveraging the robust natural language generation capabilities of the underlying bot.js framework.
