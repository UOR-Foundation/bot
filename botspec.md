### UOR Framework Bot Library Specification

This document outlines the design and implementation of a new **AI system** based on the **Universal Object Reference (UOR) Framework**. The system integrates **semantic reasoning** and **logical inference** while leveraging the unique structure of **UOR** to enhance knowledge retrieval, contextual reasoning, and dynamic learning. We conceptualize **UOR** as defining a **cortex**, with the **bot** being an implementation of that cortex, enabling more efficient data representation, content resolution, and reasoning across diverse domains.

### **Overview**

The AI system is composed of two main components:
1. **UOR Framework**: Defines the knowledge representation structure as a **cortex**, where all objects (facts, concepts, entities) are represented as **kernels** in a unified reference graph. This framework enables **semantic consistency**, **logical inference**, and the ability to **traverse across kernels** to resolve and integrate content efficiently.
2. **Bot Implementation**: The **bot** acts as the implementation of the **UOR cortex**. It manages the retrieval, inference, and interaction with the knowledge base and responds to queries using the **semantic and logical inference** provided by the **UOR Framework**.

The goal is to create a system that can represent and reason over knowledge with a **unified structure**, enabling the bot to interact, learn, and evolve across different domains. The architecture supports **multi-modal interaction**, **knowledge management**, and **dynamic learning** without requiring a rigid, domain-specific framework.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **UOR Cortex**: The **UOR framework** represents knowledge as an interconnected, directed acyclic graph (DAG) of **objects** and **relationships**. Each **object** (e.g., a fact, concept, or entity) is treated as a **kernel**, and these kernels are connected based on their **semantic relationships** and **logical structures**.
   
2. **Embeddings and Kernels**: The system uses **kernels** to represent each object (such as a fact or concept) in the knowledge base. Each kernel is an **encoded object** that contains information about the object’s properties, relations, and transformations over time.

3. **Content Resolution**: UOR allows for **dynamic content resolution**, where the system can trace across kernels to gather the necessary information based on the query context. This enables **efficient retrieval** of relevant knowledge, improving the bot’s responses.

4. **Coherence Norm**: The UOR framework enforces **consistency** and **logical coherence** across the knowledge base using the **coherence norm**. This norm ensures that all kernels align and interact consistently, preventing contradictions as new information is integrated into the system.

### **System Structure**

The bot library is broken down into several modules that interact with the **UOR framework** and handle different aspects of knowledge management, reasoning, and user interaction.

### **Core Components and Functions**

#### **1. uor-cortex.js (Core UOR Framework)**

- **`createKernel(objectData)`**  
  *Purpose*: Creates a new **kernel** (encoded object) within the **UOR framework**.  
  *Responsibilities*:  
  - Encodes the object data into a **Clifford algebra** representation.
  - Assigns a unique reference to each object in the UOR graph.
  - Ensures consistency with the overall system using the **coherence norm**.

  ```javascript
  function createKernel(objectData) {
    // Encode the object data into a kernel and ensure consistency across the system
  }
  ```

- **`linkObjects(kernel1, kernel2, relationship)`**  
  *Purpose*: Links two objects (kernels) in the UOR graph, defining their relationship.  
  *Responsibilities*:  
  - Establishes the **semantic relationship** between two objects.
  - Ensures that relationships are compatible with the **UOR graph structure**.
  - Checks that the relationship does not violate the **coherence norm**.

  ```javascript
  function linkObjects(kernel1, kernel2, relationship) {
    // Link two kernels based on the specified relationship
  }
  ```

- **`resolveContent(queryKernel)`**  
  *Purpose*: Resolves content based on the query object (kernel), tracing relevant kernels across the UOR graph.  
  *Responsibilities*:  
  - Traces relevant kernels based on their **semantic relationships**.
  - Retrieves **contextual knowledge** by following the graph links.
  - Returns a set of relevant objects (kernels) that resolve the query.

  ```javascript
  function resolveContent(queryKernel) {
    // Resolve the content by tracing related kernels in the UOR graph
  }
  ```

#### **2. bot.js (Bot Interaction)**

- **`initBot()`**  
  *Purpose*: Initializes the bot, sets up the **UOR cortex** and other necessary components.  
  *Responsibilities*:  
  - Loads and configures the **UOR framework**.
  - Initializes the **UOR database** and **schemas**.
  - Prepares the bot for user interactions.

  ```javascript
  async function initBot() {

### **Integration Flow**

1. **User Query**: A user submits a query to the bot.
2. **Query Processing**:  
   - The bot **converts** the user query into a **kernel** representation.
   - The **UOR cortex** resolves the query by tracing through related kernels in the **UOR graph**.
3. **Content Retrieval**: The relevant knowledge (kernels) is retrieved and passed to the **logic engine**.
4. **Inference and Consistency Check**:  
   - The **logic engine** applies inference and ensures consistency across the knowledge base.
   - The response is generated by combining the resolved content and inferred knowledge.
5. **User Feedback**: The bot provides a response to the user, and any new facts are added to the **UOR database**.
