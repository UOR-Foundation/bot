Once complete, I'll share the specification and detailed implementation for review.

# Self-Contained In-Browser RAG Chatbot Design

This design outlines a web-based chatbot that runs entirely in the browser, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide up-to-date, context-aware answers. The bot leverages client-side machine learning (via **Transformers.js**) for language understanding and generation, and uses **IndexedDB** for persistent storage of conversation history and knowledge. External resources (like Wikipedia or DuckDuckGo) are queried on the fly for information not already in the bot’s local context. Below, we detail the architecture, key implementation components in `bot.js`, data storage schema, and the overall execution flow.

## Architecture Overview

- **Client-Only Operation**: The chatbot runs completely in the user's browser. It loads machine learning models with *Transformers.js* (a JavaScript library for Hugging Face models) so that **no server is needed** – all inference happens locally ([Unlock the Power of AI in Your Browser with Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/blog/luigi12345/transformers-js#:~:text=Artificial%20Intelligence%20is%20no%20longer,up%20a%20world%20of%20possibilities)) ([Unlock the Power of AI in Your Browser with Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/blog/luigi12345/transformers-js#:~:text=,web%20applications%20with%20minimal%20setup)). This ensures low latency and keeps user data private in the browser.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The bot combines a local language model with external knowledge lookups. RAG improves the factual accuracy of responses by retrieving relevant documents and feeding them into the generation process ([How to Build a Chatbot Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  | Rockset](https://www.rockset.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/#:~:text=RAG%20%28Retrieval,often%20observed%20in%20traditional%20LLMs)). This helps overcome the knowledge cut-off of the local model and reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data.  
- **IndexedDB for Persistent Memory**: The browser’s IndexedDB database stores conversation history and retrieved documents as vector embeddings. By maintaining this **local knowledge base**, the chatbot retains context between turns and across sessions. Even if the page is reloaded, past conversation and fetched knowledge remain available. The vector embeddings enable semantic search of the stored content.  
- **External Content Fetching**: When the user’s query requires information not found in the local context, the bot uses web APIs (e.g., Wikipedia’s REST API or DuckDuckGo Instant Answers) to fetch fresh information. This external content is then **cached** in IndexedDB for future queries, avoiding redundant lookups.  
- **On-the-Fly Inference**: The system generates responses in real time using a small language model (for example, GPT-2 or a similar model) loaded via Transformers.js. The model’s input consists of the user query combined with relevant retrieved context (from IndexedDB and/or external fetches). The output is a conversational answer that directly addresses the query using both the model’s knowledge and the retrieved information.

## Implementation Details (`bot.js`)

The core logic resides in `bot.js`, which defines functions to initialize the system, handle user messages, manage embeddings, interface with IndexedDB, generate model responses, and fetch external data. Key functions include:

### `initBot()`: Initialization

`initBot()` sets up the chatbot’s models and database. It should be called once when the web app loads. Its responsibilities: 

- **Load Transformer Models**: Initialize the embedding model and the generation model using Transformers.js. For example, load a sentence embedding model (like `"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`) for computing embeddings, and a text-generation model (like `"Xenova/gpt2"`) for generating replies. This might use the `pipeline()` function from Transformers.js to load models for specific tasks (e.g. feature extraction for embeddings, and text-generation for the chatbot replies) ([Unlock the Power of AI in Your Browser with Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/blog/luigi12345/transformers-js#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Load%20the%20pipeline%20for,generation%27%2C%20%27gpt2)).  
- **Open IndexedDB**: Open (or create) an IndexedDB database (e.g., `"ChatbotDB"`) to persist data. During the first run, create an object store (e.g., `"documents"`) with an auto-increment key to hold our knowledge documents and chat history. We also define the structure for stored items (embedding vector, text content, and maybe a type or metadata field).  
- **Prepare Globals**: Store references to the loaded models and the database connection in global or higher-scope variables so other functions can use them. For example, keep `db` (the IndexedDB `IDBDatabase` instance), `embedder` (embedding model pipeline), and `generator` (text generation model pipeline) accessible.  

**Code – Initializing models and IndexedDB:**

```js
// Global variables for model pipelines and IndexedDB
let db, embedder, generator;

async function initBot() {
  console.log("Initializing chatbot...");

  // Load embedding model for text -> vector (uses Transformers.js)
  embedder = await window.transformers.pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2');
  // Load generation model for text -> continuation (e.g., GPT-2)
  generator = await window.transformers.pipeline('text-generation', 'Xenova/gpt2');
  console.log("Models loaded.");

  // Open (or create) IndexedDB database for storing documents
  const request = indexedDB.open('ChatbotDB', 1);
  request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    const dbInstance = event.target.result;
    // Create an object store for documents (if it doesn't exist)
    const store = dbInstance.createObjectStore('documents', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
    // We can also store an index on embeddings or text if needed (optional)
    // e.g., store.createIndex('text_idx', 'text', { unique: false });
  };
  request.onsuccess = function(event) {
    db = event.target.result;
    console.log("IndexedDB initialized.");
  };
  request.onerror = function() {
    console.error("IndexedDB initialization failed:", request.error);
  };
}
```

*Explanation:* Here we include the Transformers.js script (not shown) and use it to create pipelines. The embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) will produce a high-dimensional vector for any given text, and the generator model (`gpt2` in this example) will generate text continuations. We open an IndexedDB named **ChatbotDB** version 1, and in the upgrade needed callback, we create a `"documents"` store with an auto-incrementing primary key. Each entry in this store will hold a piece of text and its embedding. Once `initBot()` finishes, the chatbot is ready to handle messages (after `onsuccess` fires, ensuring `db` is set). 

### `handleSendMessage(query)`: Processing User Input

This is the main function that gets called whenever the user sends a message (query). It orchestrates the retrieval and generation process, implementing the RAG logic. The steps are:

1. **Embed the User Query**: Use `embedText()` to convert the user’s query into an embedding vector for semantic search.  
2. **Retrieve Relevant Context**: Call `searchDatabase(queryEmbedding)` to find any stored documents (past conversation snippets or fetched knowledge) that are semantically similar to the query. This returns a list of top-matching texts from IndexedDB, which serve as relevant context.  
3. **External Lookup (if needed)**: If the local context is insufficient or the query is on a new topic, use `fetchExternalContent(query)` to get fresh information from an external source (e.g., Wikipedia). For example, if `searchDatabase` finds no result with a high similarity score, the bot will fetch an answer snippet from Wikipedia or DuckDuckGo. This new information is then saved via `insertDocument()` into IndexedDB (caching it for future use). A caching strategy here might be: only call the external API if no stored content scores above a certain cosine similarity threshold, to avoid repetitive calls.  
4. **Compose the Prompt**: Combine the retrieved context and the current query to form the model input. For instance, the prompt could be: *"[Retrieved info]\nUser: [query]\nBot:"*, or some format that presents the knowledge and question to the generation model. The idea is to supply the model with grounding information along with the question.  
5. **Generate the Response**: Call `generateResponse(query, context)` to produce the bot’s reply using the local Transformer model. This function will use the `generator` model (e.g., GPT-2) to generate a continuation that forms the answer.  
6. **Return and Store Answer**: The generated answer is returned (to be displayed in the chat UI). Also, the new user query and the bot’s answer can be stored in IndexedDB via `insertDocument()` for maintaining the conversation history. Storing the conversation (especially the bot’s answer which may contain useful info) helps the bot remember what was discussed and avoids re-fetching the same info.  

**Code – Handling a new message with RAG:**

```js
async function handleSendMessage(userQuery) {
  console.log("User:", userQuery);
  // 1. Embed the user query for semantic search
  const queryVec = await embedText(userQuery);

  // 2. Retrieve similar context from IndexedDB
  let contextDocs = await searchDatabase(queryVec, /* topK= */ 3);
  let contextText = "";
  if (contextDocs.length > 0) {
    // Concatenate retrieved texts as context (could also filter by similarity score)
    contextText = contextDocs.map(doc => doc.text).join("\n");
  }

  // 3. If insufficient context found, fetch from external source
  if (!contextText || contextDocs[0]?.score < 0.8) {  // example threshold
    const externalInfo = await fetchExternalContent(userQuery);
    if (externalInfo) {
      console.log("Fetched external info");
      contextText += "\n" + externalInfo;
      // Cache the external info in IndexedDB for future queries
      await insertDocument(externalInfo);
    }
  }

  // 4. Compose prompt with context and user query
  let prompt;
  if (contextText.trim() !== "") {
    prompt = `${contextText}\nUser: ${userQuery}\nBot:`;
  } else {
    prompt = `User: ${userQuery}\nBot:`;  // if no context, just use the query
  }

  // 5. Generate response using local model
  const response = await generateResponse(prompt);
  console.log("Bot:", response);

  // 6. Store the user query and bot response in the database (for memory)
  await insertDocument(userQuery);
  await insertDocument(response);

  return response;
}
```

*Explanation:* When a message comes in, we immediately embed it and search our local "documents" store for related content. We take the top 3 matches (`topK=3`) for context (this could include relevant past dialog or knowledge snippets). If the best match is weak (for instance, similarity score below 0.8 on [0,1] scale), we assume the bot doesn’t know enough and call `fetchExternalContent` to retrieve new information (like a Wikipedia summary about the query topic). The fetched info is appended to the context and also stored in the DB via `insertDocument` (caching). We then build a prompt that includes the context and the user’s question, and feed it to the generation model. The model’s output is the bot’s answer, which we log and store (along with the query) for future reference. Finally, `handleSendMessage` returns the answer text to be displayed to the user. 

### `embedText(text)`: Generating Embeddings

This helper function converts a piece of text into a numeric embedding vector using the embedding model loaded by Transformers.js. The embedding represents the semantic meaning of the text in a high-dimensional space, enabling similarity comparisons.

- We use the `embedder` pipeline (initialized in `initBot`) to process the input text. This might be a Transformer model like MiniLM or SBERT that produces a fixed-length vector.  
- Typically, `pipeline('feature-extraction', model)` returns the embeddings for each token or the entire sequence. We may need to post-process the output: for example, averaging the token embeddings or taking the `[CLS]` token embedding if using a BERT-like model. Some sentence-transformer models directly return a sentence vector.  
- We ensure the resulting vector is normalized (optional but useful for cosine similarity). Normalizing means scaling the vector to unit length, which makes cosine similarity just a dot product. This step isn’t strictly required but helps if we use a fixed similarity threshold.

**Code – Embedding text to vector:**

```js
async function embedText(text) {
  // Use Transformers.js pipeline to get embeddings.
  let embeddingOutput = await embedder(text);
  // `embedder` might return an array of embeddings (for each token). 
  // We handle both cases: if it's nested (batch of token embeddings) or already a single vector.
  let vector;
  if (Array.isArray(embeddingOutput[0])) {
    // If output is 2D (e.g., [ [dim] ]), take the first element (for single input)
    vector = embeddingOutput[0];
    if (Array.isArray(vector[0])) {
      // If still 2D (token embeddings), average them
      vector = vector.reduce((acc, tokenVec) => {
        return acc.map((val, i) => val + tokenVec[i]);
      });
      vector = vector.map(val => val / embeddingOutput[0].length);
    }
  } else {
    // If directly a 1D array
    vector = embeddingOutput;
  }

  // Optional: Normalize the vector to unit length for consistent similarity
  const norm = Math.sqrt(vector.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x*x, 0));
  if (norm > 0) {
    vector = vector.map(x => x / norm);
  }
  return vector;
}
```

*Explanation:* We call `embedder(text)` which returns the embedding. Depending on the model, the output might be nested. For a sentence-transformer, it could directly return a 768-dimensional array. For a generic model’s feature extraction, it might return an array of token vectors. The code above checks and averages token embeddings if needed. Finally, it normalizes the vector. These embeddings will be stored and used for similarity matching. (In practice, one could use a pre-normalized embedding model or perform pooling as appropriate to the chosen model architecture.) 

### `insertDocument(text)`: Storing Knowledge/History

This function saves a piece of text (either user query, bot response, or external knowledge snippet) into the IndexedDB store along with its embedding. It is essentially an *ingest* operation into our local vector database.

- First, it obtains the embedding vector for the given text by calling `embedText(text)`.  
- Then it opens a read-write transaction on the “documents” object store and adds a new record. The record can be an object like `{ id: <auto>, text: <the text>, embedding: <the vector> }`. The `id` is auto-generated by IndexedDB.  
- Optionally, we could add a `source` field (e.g., `"user"`, `"bot"`, `"wiki"`, etc.) to distinguish the origin of the text, or a timestamp. This can help with filtering or debugging, though not strictly required for functionality.  

**Code – Inserting a document into IndexedDB:**

```js
async function insertDocument(text) {
  if (!db) {
    console.error("DB not initialized");
    return;
  }
  const vector = await embedText(text);
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const tx = db.transaction('documents', 'readwrite');
    const store = tx.objectStore('documents');
    const data = { text: text, embedding: vector };
    const request = store.add(data);
    request.onsuccess = () => {
      // Document stored successfully
      resolve(true);
    };
    request.onerror = () => {
      console.error("Error storing document:", request.error);
      reject(request.error);
    };
  });
}
```

*Explanation:* We create a new transaction on the `"documents"` store with readwrite access. We then `add` a new object containing the text and its embedding. IndexedDB will assign it an `id`. We wrap this in a Promise for convenience so that `await insertDocument()` works. After insertion, the data persists in the user’s browser storage. If the same text (or semantically similar text) is needed later, our search will be able to retrieve it instead of calling external APIs again. For example, if we fetched a Wikipedia snippet about “JavaScript” in one turn, it’s now saved locally; a follow-up question about JavaScript can find this snippet in the DB rather than hitting the network again (this is our caching strategy).

### `searchDatabase(queryEmbedding)`: Retrieving Similar Context

This function searches the IndexedDB "documents" store for entries that are relevant to the current query, using vector similarity. It performs a **vector similarity search** by comparing the query’s embedding to stored embeddings:

- Open a read-only transaction on the "documents" store and get all stored entries (or, if the store is large, iterate with a cursor – but for simplicity we can load all and filter in memory).  
- For each document, compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and the document’s embedding vector. Cosine similarity is a value from -1 to 1 (1 means identical direction, i.e., very similar in meaning). Since we normalized vectors at insertion, we can compute cosine similarity as the dot product of the two vectors ([Open Source Project Introduces In-browser Vector Databases to Train Autonomous Agents | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/open-source-project-introduces-in-browser-vector-databases-to-train-autonomous-agents#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Query%20,console.log%28results)).  
- Collect the top results (e.g., top 3 most similar documents). We might attach the similarity score to each result for later use (like deciding on threshold for external fetch).  
- Return the top matching documents (each with its text and maybe score). If no documents are stored yet, this will return an empty list.

**Code – Searching for similar documents:**

```js
async function searchDatabase(queryVec, topK = 3) {
  if (!db) {
    console.error("DB not initialized");
    return [];
  }
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const tx = db.transaction('documents', 'readonly');
    const store = tx.objectStore('documents');
    const getAllReq = store.getAll();
    getAllReq.onsuccess = () => {
      const allDocs = getAllReq.result;
      if (!allDocs || allDocs.length === 0) {
        resolve([]);
        return;
      }
      // Compute similarity for each stored doc
      let scoredDocs = allDocs.map(doc => {
        const docVec = doc.embedding;
        // Compute cosine similarity: dot product (since vectors are normalized)
        let score = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < queryVec.length && i < docVec.length; i++) {
          score += queryVec[i] * docVec[i];
        }
        return { text: doc.text, score: score };
      });
      // Sort by similarity descending
      scoredDocs.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
      // Return the top K results
      resolve(scoredDocs.slice(0, topK));
    };
    getAllReq.onerror = () => {
      console.error("Error reading from DB:", getAllReq.error);
      reject(getAllReq.error);
    };
  });
}
```

*Explanation:* We fetch all documents from the store (note: in a real large application, fetching all could be inefficient, but for moderate amounts of data or demo purposes this is fine). We then iterate and calculate a cosine similarity. Since both vectors are normalized to unit length, cosine similarity is just the sum of element-wise products. We then sort the documents by similarity score and take the top `topK`. Each result includes the `text` and its `score`. The calling function can then decide if the highest score is high enough or if we should call the external API. (If performance becomes an issue with many vectors, one could integrate an approximate nearest neighbor index or library. For example, the **MeMemo** toolkit implements HNSW indexing in-browser to efficiently search millions of vectors using IndexedDB and Web Workers ([MeMemo: On-device Retrieval Augmentation for Private and Personalized Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.01972v1#:~:text=client,on%20our%20work%2C%20we%20discuss)).)

### `generateResponse(query, context)`: Generating the Bot’s Reply

This function uses the loaded Transformer **generator model** to produce a response, given the user’s query and any context. In our design, we actually pass a combined prompt (context + query) to the model, so this function’s API could be just `generateResponse(prompt)` which already contains both. The function handles calling the model’s `generator` pipeline and formatting the result:

- It takes a text input (which could be just the user query or a prompt that includes retrieved context as prepared in `handleSendMessage`).  
- It runs the generation model on this input. For example, if `generator` is a text-generation pipeline for GPT-2, we call `await generator(prompt, options)` – where options might include a max length for the response, etc.  
- The output from Transformers.js pipeline is typically an array of generated texts (since it can do beam search or multiple samples). We take the first result’s generated text as the bot’s answer.  
- Some minimal post-processing can be done (e.g., remove the prompt part if the model echoes it, ensure the answer is in first-person as the bot, etc., depending on the model).  

**Code – Generating a response with the local model:**

```js
async function generateResponse(prompt) {
  if (!generator) {
    console.error("Text generation model not loaded.");
    return "";
  }
  try {
    // Use the text-generation pipeline to continue the prompt
    const output = await generator(prompt, { max_length: 200, num_return_sequences: 1 });
    // The output might be an array of sequences; take the first one
    let generatedText = "";
    if (Array.isArray(output)) {
      generatedText = output[0]?.generated_text || output[0];
    } else if (output.generated_text) {
      generatedText = output.generated_text;
    } else {
      generatedText = String(output);
    }
    // Remove the prompt from the generated text if it's included
    if (generatedText.startsWith(prompt)) {
      generatedText = generatedText.substring(prompt.length);
    }
    return generatedText.trim();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Generation error:", err);
    return "*(Sorry, I couldn't generate a response.)*";
  }
}
```

*Explanation:* We pass the prompt (which includes the context and the latest question) into the `generator`. In this snippet, `generator` is assumed to be a pipeline created with something like `pipeline('text-generation', 'Xenova/gpt2')`. The pipeline returns an object or array containing the generated continuation ([Unlock the Power of AI in Your Browser with Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/blog/luigi12345/transformers-js#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Load%20the%20pipeline%20for,generation%27%2C%20%27gpt2)). We extract the text from it. We also guard against the model simply regurgitating the prompt by stripping the prompt if it appears at the beginning of the generated text. The result is trimmed and returned as the bot’s answer. (In practice, one might use a more advanced model or add special tokens to clearly separate context and answer. For example, if using an instruction-tuned model, the prompt might be formatted like a system message or with delimiters for context. But for simplicity, we treat it as one sequence.)

### `fetchExternalContent(query)`: Retrieving Information from APIs

This function is responsible for reaching out to external knowledge sources (like Wikipedia or DuckDuckGo) to get information related to the user’s query. It will typically perform a web request (using the Fetch API) to a public endpoint, parse the result, and return a text snippet that can be used as context for answer generation. Key points:

- **Wikipedia API**: We can use Wikipedia’s REST API or MediaWiki API to get a summary of a topic. For example, the MediaWiki `action=query` with `list=search` can find relevant pages, and then `prop=extracts&explaintext` can fetch a plain-text summary of the top result. We include `&origin=*` in the query string to allow cross-origin requests from the browser ([
      How to Access Wikipedia Content with MediaWiki API in JavaScript
 – Omi AI](https://www.omi.me/blogs/api-guides/how-to-access-wikipedia-content-with-mediawiki-api-in-javascript#:~:text=async%20function%20fetchWikipediaArticle%28title%29%20,pageId%5D.extract%3B)).  
- **DuckDuckGo Instant Answer**: As a fallback, DuckDuckGo’s Instant Answer API provides topic summaries. A GET request to `https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=Your+Query&format=json&no_html=1` returns a JSON with an “AbstractText” or “Abstract” field containing a summary (if available). This is useful for queries where Wikipedia might not have a direct article or for variety of sources.  
- The function tries one or both APIs and returns a string of relevant content (could be a few sentences). If no external info is found, it returns an empty string or null. This text, when present, will be fed into the context for generation and also stored in IndexedDB as new knowledge.

**Code – Fetching from Wikipedia (with DuckDuckGo fallback):**

```js
async function fetchExternalContent(query) {
  // Try Wikipedia search + summary
  const searchUrl = `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&utf8=&format=json&origin=*`;
  try {
    const res = await fetch(searchUrl);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Wikipedia search failed");
    const data = await res.json();
    if (data.query.search && data.query.search.length > 0) {
      // Take the top search result title
      const title = data.query.search[0].title;
      // Fetch the page extract (summary) for that title
      const summaryUrl = `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&explaintext=1&titles=${encodeURIComponent(title)}&format=json&origin=*`;
      const res2 = await fetch(summaryUrl);
      const data2 = await res2.json();
      // The result is nested under pages with an unknown page ID
      const pages = data2.query.pages;
      const pageId = Object.keys(pages)[0];
      const extract = pages[pageId]?.extract;
      if (extract) {
        return extract.substring(0, 1000);  // return up to 1000 chars of extract
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn("Wikipedia lookup error:", err);
  }

  // Fallback to DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API
  try {
    const ddgUrl = `https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&format=json&no_html=1`;
    const res = await fetch(ddgUrl);
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("DuckDuckGo fetch failed");
    const data = await res.json();
    if (data.AbstractText && data.AbstractText.length > 0) {
      return data.AbstractText;
    } else if (data.Abstract && data.Abstract.length > 0) {
      return data.Abstract;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn("DuckDuckGo lookup error:", err);
  }

  // If nothing found
  return "";
}
```

*Explanation:* We first construct a Wikipedia API URL for a search query. The `list=search` call finds pages related to the user query. If we get results, we take the first result’s title and then make another API call to get that page’s extract (intro paragraph) in plain text ([
      How to Access Wikipedia Content with MediaWiki API in JavaScript
 – Omi AI](https://www.omi.me/blogs/api-guides/how-to-access-wikipedia-content-with-mediawiki-api-in-javascript#:~:text=async%20function%20fetchWikipediaArticle%28title%29%20,pageId%5D.extract%3B)). We include `origin=*` in both requests to satisfy CORS. If Wikipedia doesn’t return anything (or the fetch fails), we then query DuckDuckGo’s Instant Answer API by requesting JSON (`format=json`) without HTML (`no_html=1`). We parse the JSON for an abstract text. If found, we return that. The function ultimately returns a string that contains external knowledge relevant to the query, or an empty string if no info was obtained. This string can be a few sentences long (we truncated the Wikipedia extract for brevity).  

All the above functions together make up `bot.js`. In a real setup, these would be tied to a simple frontend UI where user messages call `handleSendMessage` and display the results. The code is designed to be asynchronous (using Promises/async-await) since it deals with model loading, inference, and network calls. 

## Data Storage & RAG Context in IndexedDB

**IndexedDB Schema**: The chatbot uses a single IndexedDB database (`ChatbotDB`) with one object store named `"documents"`. Each entry in this store represents a piece of information the bot "knows", which could be: a user utterance, a bot response, or an external knowledge snippet. The schema for a document object is for example: 

```js
{
  id: <number>,           // auto-increment primary key
  text: <string>,         // the content (utterance or info)
  embedding: <Float32Array or Array<number>> // the vector representation
  // (optional) source: "user" | "bot" | "external" etc.
  // (optional) timestamp: Date or number
}
``` 

We store the embedding as an array of numbers (which IndexedDB can serialize). Alternatively, one could store it as a binary BLOB (for efficiency) or even use a library to handle vector storage. The **key** is an auto-incrementing integer, since we just need a unique id for each entry. We don’t need complex indexes because we’re doing a full scan for similarity (for small/medium data sizes). If needed, we could add a simple index on the text field or source for debugging, but it's not required for functionality.

**Persistent Conversational Memory**: Every user query and bot answer can be stored, allowing the chatbot to remember past interactions. When the bot searches the database, it could retrieve not just factual snippets but also relevant pieces of earlier conversation. For example, if the user refers back to "that recipe you mentioned earlier", the system can find the previous response about a recipe from the conversation store. This persistent memory is maintained across sessions – closing and reopening the page will still have the IndexedDB data available, so the bot can recall previous chats (unless the user clears the site data).

**Knowledge Base Augmentation**: Retrieved external content is inserted into the same store. Over time, the database becomes a knowledge base of facts the bot has fetched. This **caching strategy** prevents repetitive external calls: if the user asks "Who is Alan Turing?" the bot might fetch a Wikipedia summary the first time and store it. If later the user asks "When was Turing born?", the bot can find the answer in the stored summary (via semantic search) without calling Wikipedia again. The system could even proactively store multiple chunks of an article if needed.  

**Vector Similarity Search**: The retrieval (`searchDatabase`) uses cosine similarity on these embeddings to decide which pieces of stored text are most relevant to the new query. By using embeddings, the bot can find relevant context even if the wording of the question differs from the wording of the stored text (semantic search). For instance, a query "What's the capital of Japan?" would have an embedding close to that of a stored sentence "Tokyo is the capital of Japan", allowing the bot to match it even if keywords differ. We chose a simple linear scan for similarity due to simplicity. This is efficient for dozens or hundreds of entries. For larger scales (thousands+ of documents), an optimized approach (like HNSW indexing as used in **MeMemo** ([MeMemo: On-device Retrieval Augmentation for Private and Personalized Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.01972v1#:~:text=client,on%20our%20work%2C%20we%20discuss)) or product quantization) could be employed to keep retrieval fast in the browser environment.

**Caching and Expiry**: (Optional) The design can include logic to avoid unbounded growth of the IndexedDB. For example, we might limit the number of conversation turns stored (evict older ones) or periodically prune external documents that were rarely used. One could implement a simple LRU policy or keep track of usage counts in the metadata. Since IndexedDB space is usually plenty for text, this is not immediately critical, but it’s a consideration for long-running or frequently-used chat sessions.

## Execution Flow (Real-Time Operation)

Putting it all together, the chatbot follows this sequence for each user interaction:

1. **User Input**: The user types a message or question in the chat interface and hits send. The frontend calls `handleSendMessage(userQuery)` with the input string.  
2. **Retrieve Context**: `handleSendMessage` embeds the query and searches IndexedDB for relevant context. For example, if the user is asking a follow-up question, this may retrieve the last few Q&A pairs or any stored fact relevant to the query. The bot now has a `contextText` (which could be empty if nothing relevant is found).  
3. **External Knowledge Fetch**: If the context is insufficient (new topic or low similarity), the bot invokes `fetchExternalContent`. This could trigger a Wikipedia API call, retrieving, say, a summary paragraph about the topic ([

The fetched content is added to the context and also saved to the DB for future use. If the context from the DB was strong enough, this step might be skipped (to save time and bandwidth).  
4. **Combine Query and Context**: The bot constructs a prompt for the language model. It may look like:  

   ```
   [Relevant info 1]\n
   [Relevant info 2]\n
   ...\n
   User: [Current question]\n
   Bot:
   ```  

   This prompt format provides the model with the necessary background to answer the question. All the context and the query are still purely in-memory at this point (aside from any needed model memory), keeping user data local.  
5. **Local Inference**: The prompt is fed to the `generator` model (running via Transformers.js in the browser). The model generates a continuation after the `"Bot:"` prompt. For instance, if the user asked "Who is Alan Turing?" and context included a Wikipedia snippet about Alan Turing, the model will generate a response like *"Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist, known as the father of modern computing..."* using that context. This inference happens entirely in the browser using WebAssembly and the downloaded model weights ([Open Source Project Introduces In-browser Vector Databases to Train Autonomous Agents | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/open-source-project-introduces-in-browser-vector-databases-to-train-autonomous-agents#:~:text=So%2C%20how%20can%20this%20kind,like%20searching%20for%20recommendations%20possible)). No query or data is sent to a server, ensuring privacy.  
6. **Respond and Learn**: The generated answer is then displayed to the user in the chat UI. Additionally, the system calls `insertDocument` to store the user’s question and the bot’s answer into IndexedDB. This updates the conversation history and knowledge base. On the next turn, these will be available for retrieval if relevant.  
7. **Repeat**: The user can ask a follow-up question, and the cycle repeats. The persistent context means the bot can handle dialogues that reference earlier parts of the conversation or previously fetched facts (e.g., *“Tell me more about his early life”* could trigger retrieving the Alan Turing summary again from the DB instead of calling Wikipedia a second time).

Throughout this flow, the user experiences a seamless conversation: they ask something, and the bot responds with informed answers that include up-to-date information when needed. The behind-the-scenes RAG mechanism – combining local LLM with a search of stored data and external API calls – is completely transparent to the user. The chatbot effectively **“learns”** with each interaction by accumulating new information in its IndexedDB. Over time, it builds a personalized knowledge base that can be queried alongside the model’s built-in knowledge.

## External API Integration Example

To illustrate the external resource integration, consider a user asks: *"What is the latest COVID-19 variant?"* This might not be in the local model’s training data if the model is old. The chatbot will use `fetchExternalContent` to get up-to-date info. For example, it will call the Wikipedia API as shown in the code above. The first call might be a search query to Wikipedia: 

```url
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=latest%20COVID-19%20variant&format=json&origin=*
``` 

This returns search results; suppose the top result is "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant". The bot then calls: 

```url
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&explaintext=1&titles=SARS-CoV-2%20Omicron%20variant&format=json&origin=*
``` 

The JSON response will contain an extract like: *"...The Omicron variant, also known as B.1.1.529, was first reported to WHO from South Africa in November 2021..."*. The bot takes this text and uses it in the response generation. After answering, it stores that extract in IndexedDB. If the user later asks, *"When was Omicron first reported?"*, the bot’s `searchDatabase` will likely find the answer in the stored extract (because it contains the date and "first reported") and can answer from that without another API call.

This demonstrates how external APIs are leveraged: the bot uses them as needed to keep its knowledge current, and by storing the results, it minimizes repeat calls. The design uses Wikipedia for detailed factual data and DuckDuckGo for quick summaries when Wikipedia isn’t suitable. These integrations ensure the chatbot remains informed about recent or specific topics, which is a key benefit of the RAG approach ([How to Build a Chatbot Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)  | Rockset](https://www.rockset.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/#:~:text=RAG%20extends%20the%20capabilities%20of,information%20for%20a%20certain%20subject)).
