# Schema Processor

1. **Structured Semantic Layer**: Create a schema-based semantic parser that recognizes entities and relationships in user queries (like Person, has_name, "Alex").

2. **Schema-Aligned Kernels**: Define kernel types that map to common schema.org types (Person, Question, Topic, etc.) with their standard properties.

3. **Semantic Graph Integration**: When processing "My name is Alex," the system would:
   - Create a Person kernel
   - Set its name property to "Alex"
   - Link it to the conversation with hasParticipant relationship
   - Assign it high relevance in context packing

4. **Web Content Integration**: The bot could fetch and embed relevant web content using schema.org markup for enhanced understanding.

5. **Working Memory as Graph**: Represent the conversation state as an explicit subgraph within the UOR lattice, with temporal relationships between turns.

This approach solves the personal memory issue while setting up the architecture for your broader vision - a system that can search the web, understand structured content, and provide answers without needing a massive language model.

The UOR framework's DAG structure is actually ideal for this, as it can model schema.org's type hierarchy and property relationships naturally. With this enhancement, bot could potentially handle both personal context and web-sourced knowledge through the same unified mechanism.
